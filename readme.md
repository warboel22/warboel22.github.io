# warboel22.github.io

this is the website for warboel, may look bad but it does its job

## why does it look the way it is?

i want my website to be as accessible as possible, regardless of device (yes even if youre using a terminal browser).
this is why i dont even use css, if you use a terminal browser as previously mentioned, you wont even notice it.

because it uses no css, it uses your system font. dyslexic and need a special font? no problem!

one barrier i would love to break is **language**, however i only speak english and am ~~definetely not i swear~~ procrastionating on dutch and german. if you wish to help break this barrier. feel free to contribute, just see the instructions

## language contributing instructions
- make a folder and name it the iso 2 letter code (i am aware of a language with only a 3 letter code, if thats the case for your language just do that. its fine.) 
- make a file and name it the same as the english version
- translate the copy from the english version to your language 
- make a pull request to the main repo
